<p>I am an International student at the <a href="https://www.mun.ca">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a>.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kgTHfdULKvvChkxm9">Mahajanga, Madagarscar</a>.</p>

<p>Having lived in a multicultural environment, and then following the French education program, I have had the opportunity to learn multiple languages, and as such can speak French and English fluently, Spanish and Gujrati at an itermediate level, and Hindi and Malagasy at a beginner level.</p>
