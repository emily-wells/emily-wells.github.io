    <h1>Experiences</h1>
    <h2>Professional experiences</h2>
    <h3>Desk Assistant</h3>
    <p class="subtitle">Association Communautaire Francophone de St. Jean, ACFSJ</p>
    <p class="more_txt">My work was concentrated at the library, working on the organization, cataloging, rental and
        returns of books.<br>
        These tasks allowed me to strenghten my organizational and time-management skills.<br>
        Being the only French facility in the region, many different events took place there, where I would get to
        play
        many different roles.</p>

    <h3>Online teaching</h3>
    <p class="subtitle">Lycée Français de Tananarive.</p>
    <p class="more_txt">Creation of an online platform aiming to facilitate the learning process of ancient Greek.
        Working with my professor, my work consisted in the elaboration of content geared towards the general
        public.<br>
        The goal was to use this platform as an aid both for professors and students, for beginners and advanced
        students alike, hence it was very important to have a user-friendly interface. <br>
        This opportunity taught me how to manage a strict timetable, but also how to team-work as I my work was
        supevised by my professor.</p>

    <h2>Personal experiences</h2>
    <h3 id="prog">Programming</h3>
    <p class="list_Item">HTML</p>
    <p class="more_txt">Paired with CSS, the markdown language HTML is known as the backbone of websites.<br>
        Very widely used, learning it has allowed me to get into front-end web development.
        <br>It is using this newly acquired knowledge that I create this website, as a project I had planned out for
        the
        summer 2018.</p>
    <p class="list_Item">Java</p>
    <p class="more_txt">Another very widely used language, learning Java taught me how to create a cleaner and more
        structured code. <br>
        I did not dig deeper or explore Java any further, as I consider other languages more polyvaent, despite Java
        being widely recognized.</p>
    <p class="list_Item">Python</p>
    <p class="more_txt">A very powerful and polyvalent programming language.
        <br>The many uses of Python makes it a must for me. Having started with this language as part of my high
        school
        curiculum, I continued exploring it, and as such is the one I am most familiar with.</p>

    <h3>Misc</h3>
    <p>Public speaking</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gasy Vert.</li>
        <p class="static_more_txt">Being a member of the sustainable development club "Gasy Vert" in high school
            allowed
            me to partake in many different events. <br>Sensibilizing the
            student corps to the issues of global warming, but also representing the student corps during meetings,
            I
            presented projects in front of the school administration.</p>
        <li>International Summit of Francophonie.</li>

        <p class="static_more_txt"> I was honored with the opportunity to speak during the graduation ceremony at
