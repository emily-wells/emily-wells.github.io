        <p>I am an International student at the <a href="http:www.mun.ca">Memorial University of Newfoundland</a>.</p>

        <p>I fluently speak English, French and Gujrati, as well as a fair bit of Spanish.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in Computer Sciences, as it has been a passion for as long as I can remember.</p>
        <p>When I am not in my cavern coding, I enjoy rock-climbing and sports, as I did a few years of aikido.</p>

      <h2>Professional experiences</h2>
        <h3>Desk Assistant</h3>
          <p class="subtitle">Association Communautaire Francophone de St. Jean, ACFSJ</p>
          <p class="more_txt">My work was concentrated at the library, working on the organization, cataloging, rental and returns of books.<br>
            These tasks allowed me to strenghten my organizational and time-management skills.<br>
          Being the only French facility in the region, many different events took place there, where I would get to play many different roles.</p>

        <h3>Online teaching</h3>
          <p class="subtitle">Lycée Français de Tananarive.</p>
          <p class="more_txt">Creation of an online platform aiming to facilitate the learning process of ancient Greek.
          Working with my professor, my work consisted in the elaboration of content geared towards the general public.<br>
            The goal was to use this platform as an aid both for professors and students, for beginners and advanced students alike, hence it was very important to have a user-friendly interface. <br>
          This opportunity taught me how to manage a strict timetable, but also how to team-work as I my work was supevised by my professor.</p>

          <p class="more_txt">Paired with CSS, the markdown language HTML is known as the backbone of websites.<br>
            Very widely used, learning it has allowed me to get into front-end web development.
          <br>It is using this newly acquired knowledge that I create this website, as a project I had planned out for the summer 2018.</p>
          <p class="list_Item">Java</p>
            <p class="more_txt">Another very widely used language, learning Java taught me how to create a cleaner and more structured code. <br>
            I did not dig deeper or explore Java any further, as I consider other languages more polyvaent, despite Java being widely recognized.</p>
          <p class="list_Item">Python</p>
            <p class="more_txt">A very powerful and polyvalent programming language.
            <br>The many uses of Python makes it a must for me. Having started with this language as part of my high school curiculum, I continued exploring it, and as such is the one I am most familiar with.</p>
