# About me

![Emily Wells](/assets/images/me.jpg){: #me }


I am an alumna of [Memorial University](https://www.mun.ca), currently a Plastic Pollution Outreach and Research intern with [WWF-Canada](http://www.wwf.ca/) and [Conservation Corps NL](http://www.ccnl.ca/).

I was born and raised in [Conception Bay South, Newfoundland](https://goo.gl/maps/L1VTgUeWwL2wycue6).

My work primarily specializes in environmental outreach and research. I am bilingual in English and French, and know American Sign Language (ASL) at a beginner level.

Land acknowledgement: Newfoundland and Labrador are the traditional territories of diverse Indigenous groups, and I acknowledge with respect the diverse histories and cultures of the Beothuk, Miâ€™kmaq, Innu, and Inuit of this province.
