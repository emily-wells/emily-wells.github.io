# About me

![Sohil Pramij](/assets/images/me_resized.jpg){: #me }


I am an International student at the [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca).

I was born and raised in [Mahajanga, Madagarscar](https://goo.gl/maps/kgTHfdULKvvChkxm9).

Having lived in a multicultural environment, and then following the French education program, I have had the opportunity to learn multiple languages, and as such can speak French and English fluently, Spanish and Gujrati at an itermediate level, and Hindi and Malagasy at a beginner level.
