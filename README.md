# Mark-II

## Relocation of the repository
Second version of my personal static website. Based on HTML and CSS, with both French and English versions. 

As a small project for the summer 2018, decided to create a website for my online resume.

Version 1 was not tracked on GitHub and served its purpose as a way for me to get familiarized with front-end development.
This version aims to fix all of the things I ignored the first time, provide better compatibility over different platforms, and be more aesthetically pleasing


## Goals:
- try to make use of Javascript to make it more lively
- make a version that takes advantage of Bootstrap
